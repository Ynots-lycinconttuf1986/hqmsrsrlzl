OMG, just watched The Ugly Stepsister, and I have so many thoughts bouncing around in my head! Like, first off, the plot twists were kinda mind-blowing, but in that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see that coming‚Äù way, you know what I mean? Seriously, how did they come up with that ending? üòÇ

> Dude, the characters were all over the place. The main girl? Total trainwreck at times, but in a relatable way, if you‚Äôve ever done something stupid cuz you thought it was a good idea at the time. Those stepsisters were intense, and not in that fairy tale way you usually think of! They really brought some unexpected vibes to the whole thing.

And the music, man ‚Äì so good but so weird in places. One minute you're vibing, the next you're like, ‚ÄúWait, what even is this?‚Äù But hey, I gotta admit, being kinda low-key tired added to the whole experience. It's like your brain‚Äôs constantly playing catch-up, so everything is like FIVE times more dramatic. Or at least felt like it last night when I finally decided to download the movie.

The set design was chef's kiss though. Gave me those retro vibes mixed with some ultra-modern touches, super bizarre but also refreshing. Anyone else feels like they really wanted to break every single mold in the book? I mean, almost like the movie truly wanted to dance to its own beat ‚Äì those visuals painted a whole new picture of what a fairy tale setting could look like.

Went into full over-analyze mode while chatting with Nina. She‚Äôs all like, ‚ÄúGirl, you need some sleep,‚Äù but I‚Äôm just vividly describing how they managed to pull all that off with so little CGI. Talk about dedication! Really thinking to watch the movie again soon, just to catch everything I probably missed the first time around. Must be a ton of hidden gems packed in there.

for(int i=0; i<10; i++) { cout << i; } // like why did this even pop in my head?? 

Anyway, I think I'm gonna crash and process that rollercoaster ride. Catch you later maybe? The Ugly Stepsister has officially scrambled my brain, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I loved every confusing minute of it. üòÖ
